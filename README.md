Downloading and Updating Database
---------------------------------

First, be sure to stop and remove any existing MongoDB container associated
with this project that you may have.
(The relevant commands are `docker stop` and `docker rm`.)
Then, in the `db` directory, run `./run.sh`, then `./download-prod.sh`,
then `./upload-prod.sh`.
Open an issue for any further issues that develop within this process.
